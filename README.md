# Enzyme-constrained genome-scale metabolic model of S. aureus strain S0385.

This repository contains the julia code to build the ecGSMM, as well as the scripts to reproduce the results in chapter 3 of my doctoral thesis: 'Enzyme-constrained genome-scale metabolic model of _Staphylococcus aureus_ and its implications for drug target finding'.

## How to build the model 

Using a
